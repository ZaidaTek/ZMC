It's currently measuring a temperature of 25.6 deg C, the CPU load in the last second was 0.7%, it is 04:38:-- on the 257th day of the year (ordinal; it is also possible to use YYMM and not use the watchdog indicator), the watchdog indicator indicates it is an uneven second (one can follow the full time if watching for longer than 10s, as otherwise only the decamal is shown as a digit), the bar is (also) displaying that sensor channel, the top is 26.0 deg C, the bottom is 24.4 deg C, the total time of the bar is 1h, which consists of 12 points (each an averaged 5 mins of the preceding higher resolution) and the minimum logged value in this 1h-timeframe is 25.2 deg C, thank you very much! :D")
